# 1. What happens if we change random.randrange(1, 6) to random.randrange(1, 5)? Make the change and run the program a few times to see the result. What seems to be the new range of numbers that pop up?
# The range of numbers will be from 1 to 4. It generates numbers from 1 to 4.

# 2. After the import statement, use the random.seed() function and give it an integer like random.seed(400). What do you notice? What happened to the random numbers? 
# What I notice is the random numbers are no longer random. 

# 3. Change to random seed to something else and observe the behavior. What happens to the random numbers?
# The random numbers change. They are now different from the previous sequence.

# 4. There are a couple popular games I can think of that use this concept of a “seed”. Why do you suppose they use it and what does it do in the game?
# If a player wants to share their experience or recreate a specific scenario, they can use the same seed to generate the same world or level.
